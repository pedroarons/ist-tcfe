\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}
\paragraph{}
\par The objective of this laboratory assignment is to study an AC/DC converter circuit, designed by the group. One can see the circuit in the figure \ref{Designed Circuit}, consisting in a full wave rectifier composed of 4 diodes, an envelope detector and a voltage regulator made of a resistor and 20 diodes in series, keeping the voltage at about 12V. A comparison will be done between the NgSpice simulation and the theoretical analysis of the circuit.
\par The main objective will be to further learn about both methods of analysis, learning about their similarities, differences and which positive and negative sides each of them have.

In Section~\ref{sec:analysis}, a theoretical analysis of the circuit is
presented. In Section~\ref{sec:simulation}, the circuit is analysed by
simulation with NgSpice. In Section~\ref{sec:conclusion}, the conclusions of this study are outlined and a comparison between the results obtained in Section~\ref{sec:analysis} and Section~\ref{sec:simulation}.
